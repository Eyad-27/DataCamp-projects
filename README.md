# Data Projects Portfolio üìä

This repository is a central hub for all my guided and hands-on projects completed during my DataCamp journey and ongoing learning in **Data Analysis**, **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Machine Learning**.  

Each project highlights real-world scenarios where I applied Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques to solve problems and extract actionable insights.

## üèÜ [Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/Eyad-27/visualizing-nobel-prize-winners)

Analyze Nobel Prize winner data to explore patterns in gender, birth country, decade trends, first female laureates, and repeat winners.  
This project focuses on data wrangling, aggregation, and visualization to uncover historical trends across award categories.

- **Key Deliverables:** Filtered and counted winners by gender and birth country using pandas DataFrames; computed decade-level ratios of US-born winners; identified decade-category combinations with highest female laureates; extracted first female Nobel Prize winner; generated repeat winners list.  
- **Skills Used:** Python (pandas, numpy), data wrangling, grouping & aggregation, filtering, dictionary/list manipulation, data visualization (line plots & relational charts).

## üè´ [Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores](https://github.com/Eyad-27/exploring-NYC-school-results)

Analyze SAT performance across New York City public schools to uncover insights on math proficiency, top-performing schools, and borough-level score variability.  
This project focuses on filtering, grouping, and analyzing educational data with pandas to answer real-world policy-driven questions.  

- **Key Deliverables:** Identified schools with strong math performance, ranked top 10 schools by SAT scores, and calculated borough-level score variability with descriptive statistics.  
- **Skills Used:** Python (pandas, numpy), data wrangling, grouping & aggregation, sorting, descriptive statistics, exploratory analysis.

## üìΩÔ∏è [Investigating Netflix Movies](https://github.com/Eyad-27/investigating-Netflix-movies)

Explore Netflix‚Äôs 1990s movie catalog through exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The project focuses on identifying the most frequent movie duration and counting short action movies released in that decade.  

- **Key Deliverables:** Filtered 1990s movies with **pandas**, performed EDA to find common durations, applied data cleaning and subsetting for genres, and strengthened **matplotlib visualization** skills.  
- **Skills Used:** Python (pandas, matplotlib), EDA, data cleaning, visualization, conditional logic.
