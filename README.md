# Data Projects Portfolio 📊

This repository is a central hub for all my guided and hands-on projects completed during my DataCamp journey and ongoing learning in **Data Analysis**, **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Machine Learning**.  

Each project highlights real-world scenarios where I applied Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques to solve problems and extract actionable insights.

## 📽️ [Investigating Netflix Movies](https://github.com/Eyad-27/investigating-Netflix-movies)

Explore Netflix’s 1990s movie catalog through exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The project focuses on identifying the most frequent movie duration and counting short action movies released in that decade.  

- **Key Deliverables:** Filtered 1990s movies with **pandas**, performed EDA to find common durations, applied data cleaning and subsetting for genres, and strengthened **matplotlib visualization** skills.  
- **Skills Used:** Python (pandas, matplotlib), EDA, data cleaning, visualization, conditional logic.
