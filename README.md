# Data Projects Portfolio üìä

This repository is a central hub for all my guided and hands-on projects completed during my DataCamp journey and ongoing learning in **Data Analysis**, **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Machine Learning**.  

Each project highlights real-world scenarios where I applied Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques to solve problems and extract actionable insights.
