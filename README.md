# Data Projects Portfolio üìä

This repository is a central hub for all my guided and hands-on projects completed during my DataCamp journey and ongoing learning in **Data Analysis**, **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Machine Learning**.  

Each project highlights real-world scenarios where I applied Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques to solve problems and extract actionable insights.

## üìÇ Projects  
Below are the projects I‚Äôve completed so far:

---

## üìΩÔ∏è [Investigating Netflix Movies](https://github.com/Eyad-27/investigating-Netflix-movies)

Explore Netflix‚Äôs 1990s movie catalog through exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The project focuses on identifying the most frequent movie duration and counting short action movies released in that decade.  

- **Key Deliverables:** Filtered 1990s movies with **pandas**, performed EDA to find common durations, applied data cleaning and subsetting for genres, and strengthened **matplotlib visualization** skills.  
- **Skills Used:** Python (pandas, matplotlib), EDA, data cleaning, visualization, conditional logic.

## üè´ [Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores](https://github.com/Eyad-27/exploring-NYC-school-results)

Analyze SAT performance across New York City public schools to uncover insights on math proficiency, top-performing schools, and borough-level score variability.  
This project focuses on filtering, grouping, and analyzing educational data with pandas to answer real-world policy-driven questions.  

- **Key Deliverables:** Identified schools with strong math performance, ranked top 10 schools by SAT scores, and calculated borough-level score variability with descriptive statistics.  
- **Skills Used:** Python (pandas, numpy), data wrangling, grouping & aggregation, sorting, descriptive statistics, exploratory analysis.
